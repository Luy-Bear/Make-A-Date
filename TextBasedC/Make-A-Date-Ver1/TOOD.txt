TODO:
    Flag Parsing
        Adjust the flag searching to limit the potential options on read to group/dsc/asc
        Adjust flag searching to throw error if coloumns arent listed even before printing?
        Figure out why i can list 100 items args in the flag and it not be an issue with the [10]

    Printing Method
        Now i have a list of columns to include/exclude and order by adjust printing method to print properly and not have mem leaks!
        Bunch of select case/if statements:
            - Calls a helper function to generate string of column value
            - Adjust string for formatting
            - Then prints row!
