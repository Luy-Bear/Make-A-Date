### Problem Project Aims to Solve
In the modern day, it is very easy to get ideas for dates from various sources. May it be YouTube, Instagram, snapchat, Reddit, friends, adverts and even the age-old classic of seeing it yourself!

What isn’t as easy is combining all these ideas for a date from their sources and formats and having them all in one, nice and readable place. Personally, I found I had several Instagram collections that ended up mixing, were hard to read, sometime sensitive opportunities were drowned under a wall of coffee shops and restaurants. When it came time to plan a date it proved its own challenge that resulted in dates that could’ve been planned with more ease.

Additionally, if you and your partner have different system preferences - maybe you have an android, and they have an IOS device or one of you prefers desktop over mobile applications - it only complicates the matter!

### How It Will Solve This 
I personally required this problem solved and I can only imagine other too, I took it upon myself to rise to the challenge and create a code based solution that would challenge, hone and develop my skills as a junior developer.

### Text Based Solution in C
To do this, the plan was to develop a local text based solution in C, found in the repo under “TextBasedC”. This was a proof of concept that allowed me to better understand the challenges this project had. 

This solution, which is currently a work in progress, is fully local and command line based. As of writing it:
- [X] reads from a JSON file
- [X] Prints out objects 
- [X] Prints user chosen fields in a specific format
- [X] Orders based on user chosen field 
  - [X] in ascending 
  - [X] in descending order
  - [ ] Deals with special case for string calendar date formats
- [ ] Searches for user inputted text
  - [ ] can look if desired in specific attributes only
- [ ] Writes to JSON file

### Future Goals
The next stage in development is to make it more than a simple local storage application and use some sort of cloud storage or user to user storage. As of writing it has not been decided

From here, the next stage would be making it a website using HTML/CSS/JS and learning in the progress. This solves cross platform compatibility and would use the synchronisation technology from before. Although it will require different logic and most likely translation of said logic to different languages such as PHP.

From here I would use the JS knowledge gained to learn react native and make a cross platform mobile application that.
